* For version 2.x 

i. Open Command Prompt (with elevated privileges as necessary) and execute the following command: 

`sc delete iPharmService `

ii. Verify the output below: 

![output from sc delete iPharmService](DeleteService.png)

* For versions 3.x – 5.x: 

Uninstall any existing PBS services using the Windows Uninstaller feature. Example program names are provided below, however the exact name may vary depending on the environment: 

PBSOnlineService 

PBSReconciliationService 

4. Delete the entire `[ProgramsPath]\CSC\i.Pharmacy PBS Online folder `


##	Uninstall previous versions of Tomcat and the JDK

# Add an endpoint for PBS Online to the PCMS
Refer to PCMS documentation for more details.

## Add a Service Provider URL for the PBSOnline Url

In the `ServiceProciderUrls` section of the PCMS configuration, add an entry for the url https://medicareaustralia.gov.au/PBS

eg

```
 "ServiceProviderUrls": [
    {
      "Code": "PBSOL",
      "Url": "https://medicareaustralia.gov.au/PBS"
    }
  ],
  ```

## Create Local Certificate Store

1. Create Local Certificates

Create Root Key:

`openssl.exe genrsa -des3 -out rootCA.key 4096`

Create and self sign the Root Certificate:

`openssl.exe req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key -sha256 -days 1024 -out rootCA.crt`

Create the certificate key:

`openssl.exe genrsa -out mydomain.com.key 2048`

Create the signing (csr):

`openssl.exe req -new -key mydomain.com.key -out mydomain.com.csr`

Generate the certificate using the mydomain csr and key along with the CA Root key:

`openssl.exe x509 -req -in mydomain.com.csr -CA rootCA.crt -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out mydomain.com.crt -days 500 -sha256`

Convert CA cert and key to pfx file

`openssl.exe pkcs12 -export -in rootCA.crt -inkey rootCA.key -out CA.pfx`

Convert client cert and key to pfx file

`openssl.exe pkcs12 -export -in mydomain.com.crt -inkey mydomain.com.key -out mydomain.com.pfx -certfile rootCA.crt`

2. Install “CA.pfx" into “Current User” and “Trusted Root Certification Authorities"

3. Install “mydomain.com.pfx" into “Current User" and “Personal”

4. Connect to PCMS ( eg go to https://localhost:5001/Admin/Devices in your browser) and login with User "Admin""

5. Setup and register endpoints and certificates in PCMS.

The url of the Endpoint created is entered into the `appsettings.json` file under the PBS Online directory. Refer to next section for details.

            }
        ]
    }

    
## Logging settings

By default, log files are created in the `C:/PBSOnlineLogs` directory (which will be created, if possible). 
The location and rolling frequency are controlled by the `fileName` element in the `NLog` section. 
The default filename contains the special code `${shortdate}`, which means to place the current date into the filename, and generate a new file each day.

An alternate log file location can be specified by appending a full or relative path name in the value of the `fileName` element, eg:

    "fileName": "C:\\Logs\\PBSOnline-${shortdate}.log",

The service uses the `Nlog` framework for logging, which is highly configurable with regard to logging targets, log rolling, and log formats. 
See https://nlog-project.org/config/ for more details.

    Note: Dedalus cannot provide support for Nlog, and does not recommend changing its configuration other than the log file location.

Log level can be controlled by the `minLevel` element in the `rules` section. Allowable values are:

* "Trace" - Very detailed log messages, potentially of a high frequency and volume. Not recommended, unless specifically asked to by Dedalus support.

* "Debug" -Less detailed and/or less frequent debugging messages. Not recommended, unless specifically asked to by Dedalus support.

* "Info" - Informational messages. Suitable for production use.

* "Warn" - Warnings messages only. Suitable for production use, if "Info" generates too many messages.

* "Error" - Error messages only.

* "Fatal" - Fatal error messages. After a fatal error, the application usually terminates.

# Troubleshooting

## Losing connection to database
If the PBS Online Service is unable to contact a database at start up, or loses connection with a database while it is running, it will continue to process.
The PBS Online Service will attempt to connect to the database regularly, and once connection is established, it will process messages from that database as normal.

When the service is not able to connect to a database, it will generate Error log messages similar to:

```
